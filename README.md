# Tokenized Robotics Swarm Intelligence Networks

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing and coordinating robotics swarms using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized network for robotics swarm management, featuring manufacturer verification, swarm coordination, task allocation, performance optimization, and safety protocols. The system ensures secure, transparent, and efficient operation of robot swarms through blockchain technology.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **Manufacturer Verification Contract** (`manufacturer-verification.clar`)
    - Validates swarm robotics systems and manufacturers
    - Manages manufacturer registration and certification
    - Tracks robotics system verification status

2. **Swarm Coordination Contract** (`swarm-coordination.clar`)
    - Manages robot swarm behavior and formation
    - Handles robot registration and swarm assignment
    - Coordinates swarm commands and positioning

3. **Task Allocation Contract** (`task-allocation.clar`)
    - Distributes tasks among available robot swarms
    - Matches swarm capabilities with task requirements
    - Tracks task completion and performance

4. **Performance Optimization Contract** (`performance-optimization.clar`)
    - Enhances swarm intelligence efficiency
    - Records and analyzes performance metrics
    - Applies optimization algorithms to improve operations

5. **Safety Protocol Contract** (`safety-protocol.clar`)
    - Ensures swarm robotics safety compliance
    - Manages safety zones and incident reporting
    - Implements emergency stop mechanisms
